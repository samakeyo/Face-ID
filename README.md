# Deep Facial Recognition for User Authentication

Developed a deep facial recognition application for user authentication using Deep Learning, replicating the methodology outlined in the paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition." This project includes a model built with Python, Jupyter, Numpy, OpenCV, Keras, and Tensorflow. The model is integrated into a Kivy app, allowing it to be used for user authentication.
